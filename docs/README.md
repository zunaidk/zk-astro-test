# AI Documentation

This folder contains files for customizing the AI assistant.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ai-instructions.md` | Your preferences, custom APIs, guidelines |
| `notes.md` | AI scratchpad for project notes |

## How It Works

- **ai-instructions.md** - Edit this to tell the AI your preferences (coding style, design choices) and document any custom utilities you've added.

- **notes.md** - The AI writes notes here about decisions made or patterns discovered.

The AI reads your instructions automatically with each message.
